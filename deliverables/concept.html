This will be a flying game where the plane will be your arm thanks to the Myo armband.
Any rotation of the arm will affect the orientation of the plane onscreen.
You play as Bobby Apple, pilot of Stark Enterprises and you need to deliver a payload to your destination.
Gestures will allow you to engage in dogfights, slow in-game time, and also navigate menus to make decisions.
The goal of the game is to utilize a new device to better immerse the user into the game and also allow for exercise or physical therapy.
<br>

Use the Myo armband to transform your arm into a plane to navigate the skies. Use gestures to fight off enemies and control your destiny! (137 char.)
